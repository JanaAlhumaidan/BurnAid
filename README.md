# BurnAid🔥
An AI model that classifies burn injuries (first, second, and third-degree burns) from images 
The model has achieved 77% accuracy in burn classification.

# Key Contributions:

	•	Integrated EfficientNet as the backbone of the deep learning model, leveraging its pre-trained features for improved accuracy.
	•	Enhanced the model architecture with dropout layers and ReLU activations to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
	•	Applied data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotations, scaling) to increase model robustness and performance with limited training data.
	•	Optimized training using step-based learning rate scheduling to accelerate convergence and fine-tune performance.


BurnAid empowers healthcare professionals and individuals to quickly and accurately assess burn injury levels, enabling timely and appropriate treatment.
